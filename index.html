        <p>I’m Ying Zhou, a documentary film producer and journalist based in Boston. I recently graduated from Boston University with a master’s degree in mass communication. Prior to that I got my bachelor’s in broadcast journalism at Shanghai International Studies University.</p>

        <p>Currently I’m a journalist and staff writer at <a href="http://ny.uschinapress.com/weekly/bos.html">The China Press</a>, focusing on Asian communities, particularly with respect to affordable housing policy. Previously I worked for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Thinking BIG campaign, where I created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/U.S.PIRG/videos/10156116271933080/">explainer videos</a> about human rights, e-waste, and environmental protection. In 2016, I worked as the first AD of the award-winning documentary series, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYiY8SEyq5E&list=PL-077FFdEZ1OOFuGHaxhOnuUCWWo6ix41&index=0">The Great Meal</a></em>.</p>

        <p>As a documentary film producer and journalist, my interests are human rights, gender equality, public health, food safety, and AIDS prevention. In 2014 I interviewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Yaojie">Gao Yaojie</a>, a Chinese gynecologist, academic, and AIDS activist.</p>
