        <h2>An 86-Year-Old Fighter</h2>
        <p>Gao Yaojie, a Chinese gynecologist and life-long AIDS activist, was named one of the “Ten People Who Moved China” in 2003. Her work, especially her discovery of the Plasma Economy in Henan province made her split with the Chinese authority, resulting in her moving to the US in 2009.</p>
        <p><em>Researched, conducted, translated, and edited by Ying Zhou. (The original interview was conducted in Chinese in 2014.)</em></p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: Dr. Gao, what have you been up to lately?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: Writing books and preparing lectures. I want to give you three books that I wrote these years, about AIDS in China. You can take them with you when you leave. I now have heart disease, high blood pressure, and two thrombi. You can see my feet are swollen. Sometimes I can’t breathe, and my lips turn purple. So there’s no use for me to keep all of those books. If you had come six months later, I would be able to publish another one by then. People in the publishing house asked why I continue writing books. I said I’m dying. I wrote them in bed. I feel like if I don’t write them down, no one would know the truth and reality. You know nothing either even though you’re from China.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: So I know that after you retired, you visited the countryside and discovered the scandal there, the Plasma Economy. What did you do about that?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: I visited a 3,000-person village in 2000, fifteen hundred people were selling blood. Eight hundred tested positive for HIV. And there were 500 left untested. That’s how serious it was. Nobody knows how many people died because of this. It leaves a gap in historical record forever. It’s not just in Henan. This is national. I retired when I was 63 and now I’m 90. I got plenty of time after I retired because I didn’t go back to work. After I went to the countryside and discovered this, I started writing and compiling. I made booklets about AIDS and distributed them to the villagers for free. All free. The villagers went wild for them. They couldn’t afford to buy those things. They were so poor. They were selling blood for money. How could they afford anything? I don’t need money. All my children are having a good life, so I don’t need money. So, like I told you, I went out [to the countryside] to give away money.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: Who has been sending you the money now?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: No idea. The money just appears in my bank account every month. Five hundred and three dollars. At the beginning, my identity was the visiting scholar of Columbia University, for two years. After that, they gave me another position as Hillary Clinton’s Guest. It was weird that she knows about me. There was a time I got a letter from her right after I got out of the hospital. She knew I was sick.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: Have you ever met Hillary?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: Four times. It’s always okay if she wants to see me. If I want to see her, there’s no way to find her on my end, haha.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: What did she say to you when you met?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: I had no idea what she was talking about. I only remember she said she was 20 years younger than me. [Imitating the way Hillary speaks] Wa wa wawa… </p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: Alright. So Dr. Gao, can you tell me about the current AIDS situation in China?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: That’s way too miserable. The Plasma Economy. The youngest kid who got involved was only seven years old. I want everybody to know that. This is a national problem. During the period of the Nationalist Party, [the West] called us the “sick man of Asia”. Now I’d say it’s the “dead man of Asia.” AIDS. You die if you have AIDS. They calculated in 1995 that there were five million. From 1995 till now, I’d say another one million, at least. Fake doctors and fake drugs. Those people put pig feed into capsules and told people it was a drug specific for HIV. I have a lecture in Columbus University soon and I’m going to talk about this. The provincial governor has been helping me end this. Failed. It turns out that it is deeply rooted in the central government. I don’t care what you heard from other sources. What I’m telling you is the actual situation in China. I used to go back to Chinese universities to do presentations. I visited eight last time. Now I’m not healthy anymore. I can’t travel that far. You see that I can’t even go anywhere without my walker. I’m not sure if you’d be able to see me next year. But after all I’m Chinese. My ashes need to be back home after I die.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: I know you were suffering when you were doing research in China. What eventually made you decide to move to America?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: Two reasons. Some of the governmental officials, they abused me. They didn’t come arrest me. Instead, they put police officers outside of my apartment. They tracked my use of computers, televisions, and telephones. The other reason, which was even more troubling, was the fake doctors and fake drugs. Those doctors kept coming to me, trying to get me to collude with them to “cure AIDS”. I mean, are you even human? There’s no cure for AIDS! How can you cure AIDS? So I moved.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: Ever thought about moving back to China?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: Now my image in China is getting better. The National Library of China has been asking for my books! A lot of students in universities are reading my books too. A professor from Beijing University has came to talk to me many times. He said, “Come back to China! If you don’t want to stay in Henan, come to Beijing.” I said no. I will only come back to China as ashes. I don’t even want to keep my ashes. I want them to be poured into the Yellow River and vanished. I don’t need to leave anything behind. You get yourself into trouble if you leave things. Bad people would say they were your friends when you were alive, so don’t leave any fame or fortune.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: So why aren’t you moving back?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: Would things change if I’m back?! I have different beliefs from them! My beliefs are that I don’t deny the Communist Party but I seek truth from facts. Everything I wrote, I have photos and explanations for them. And I’m not at all catering to Western countries either. I think we should be neither humble nor pushy, and admit our mistakes. As a human, you should at least become someone useful and not a chess piece or a tool for anybody else. Be yourself and have your own human dignity.</p>
        <h3><strong>YZ</strong>: Well said. Dr. Gao, what did you mean by “a tool for anybody else”?</h3>
        <p><strong>GY</strong>: For example, you follow something or someone without thinking or seeking the truth. In the end, you become the scapegoat. Isn’t that a tool? Actually, I don’t want young people, like you, to always move up [in society]. I hope you could go down, down to the countryside, to take a look at those poor places. That is the real situation in China. Very miserable.</p>
