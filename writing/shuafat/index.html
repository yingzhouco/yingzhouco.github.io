        <h2>Shuafat – “We Are Orphans Here” Essay Critique</h2>
        <p>Novelist Rachel Kushner spent a weekend in the Shuafat Refugee Camp in East Jerusalem, where she felt both safe and obscene. Recounting her time there in her first journalistic piece <em>&quot;We Are Orphans Here&quot;</em>, Kushner, a privileged outsider, vividly describes the camp through stark contrasts—life and death, peace and chaos, hope and despair—captivating and resonating with the reader.</p>
        <p>Kushner begins her story with a rich depiction of the surroundings. Some of the kids who were following her &quot;looked like cool kids the world over.&quot; The high-rise apartments she passed by were so close to each other that &quot;if a fire should happen ... there would be no way to put it out.&quot; Garbage was everywhere, often burned, emitting flames and &quot;a smell you get used to.&quot; Her descriptive language allows the reader to be immersed in the camp as she goes. See it, smell it, and feel it.</p>
        <p>Kushner deepens the story by drawing contrasts from what she saw while walking around Shuafat with the community organizer, Baha, a hope for the &quot;orphans&quot;. Among the muddy roads and garbage piles, white is the favorite color. While burning the garbage near the separation wall is &quot;symbolic&quot;, dealing drugs along the wall is not. The toxic drug is called &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot;, but it&#39;s popular among children. In the mall, &quot;bulldozed twice by Israeli authorities&quot;, there&#39;s a toy store called &quot;Happy Child&quot; and a travel agency called &quot;Hope.&quot; She talked with Baha&#39;s wife about music lessons for kids&#39; development, yet all she could hear was gunfire.</p>
        <p>Kushner is a master of using numbers both to create tragic atmospheres and narrative twists. &quot;Mr. Nice Guy,&quot; she writes, &quot;is popular with kids as young as <em>eight</em>.&quot; &quot;Empty packets of it&quot; were found at the parking lot where &quot;<em>six thousand</em> children&quot; were picked up and commuted daily to the <em>one</em>-and-only public school outside the camp. She also writes that Baha is optimistic about their <em>eighty-person</em> emergency team, but it unexpectedly breaks your heart when you learn that <em>fifteen</em> days after Kushner left the camp, he was murdered. She continues with even more numbers: an unknown person shot at him &quot;<em>ten</em> times … <em>seven</em> bullets hit him.&quot;</p>
        <p>Her use of imagery and her somber tone carry the reader through her many emotional ups and downs. When she was describing her wanting to give earrings to a child without ears, she writes, &quot;I felt obscene. I sat and smiled as if my oversize (sic) teeth could beam a protective fiction over this child, blind us both to the truth … that her life was going to be difficult.&quot; She gives readers a specific type of heartbreak that they can relate to in no time.</p>
        <p>Rachel Kushner ends the story with a newborn baby. After Baha&#39;s death. Just like the life and death she experienced, the safety and obscenity she felt. Just like they say &quot;we are orphans here&quot; when they are not; there is hope there, but perhaps, only hope.</p>
