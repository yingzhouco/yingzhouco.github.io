        <p>This American Life aired an episode called “In Defense of Ignorance” on April 22nd, 2016 in which stories and examples of ignorance were shared, proving that sometimes there can be a benefit, a bliss, or even an asset to not knowing. Lulu Wang, an American writer and filmmaker, told a story about her family’s white lies towards her grandmother who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and only got three months to live. The story stands out because of its empathetic topic – sickness and death – with a unique narrative style and the open ending which is thought-provoking for listeners.</p>
        <p>When Wang’s grandmother, or Nainai, as she is called in the episode, was diagnosed with terminal stage-four cancer. Her family – unlike Wang who wanted to comfort and talk with her grandmother – decided to keep the secret and return to China from abroad immediately with the excuse of Wang’s uncle’s wedding of that was to be held in China. During the whole process of the wedding, or the final meeting with Nainai before she died, Wang tried very hard to keep the secrets and her inner grief, and it seemed all the other family members were laughing with tears inside. Finally, it turned out that Nainai was still alive after three years, and she, in the same way, concealed her diagnosis of breast cancer so that other family members would not worry about her.</p>
        <p>What interests us and keeps us focused when listening to a story of personal experiences? Resonance and empathy. Wang’s story talks about cancer and the situation that someone she loves is dying, which is an unavoidable occurrence in everyone’s life. People who have experienced this before may be interested in finding out what Wang did when faced with this situation and compare it to themselves. People who haven’t suffered this may take the story as a preview, thinking of what they would feel and do when that day eventually comes. Either way, Wang has successfully lead you into the story because you start thinking of your own family and decisions. And once you put yourself into the story, you will have agreements or disagreements about what Wang said. Whether you support or oppose her position, you are captured by the story. The story wins.</p>
        <p>Then, what are we looking for when we listen to a story with a common topic? The twist. We have heard hundreds of stories about cancer, the death of family members, and white lies from our parents, friends, newspapers, and the television. Even the outcome of Nainai -- who lived for three years even though she was diagnosed with terminal stage cancer -- cannot surprise us anymore. These kinds of miracles are not new to us. Let’s see how Wang breaks through the cliché. Actually, she is the twist. Wang was opposed to lying to Nainai, “I was totally against this,” she said. “When I heard the news, I wanted to talk with my grandmother, comfort her.” Instead, she was forced to do the whole thing during which she kept arguing with her family and tried to understand both sides. Wang’s position made her narrate differently, with mixed feelings or even anger sometimes. All this arguing, questions, and mixed feelings make the story more interesting, emotional and touching.</p>
        <p>Even in the end, we still couldn’t tell whether Wang was convinced by her aunt and grandma that lying to Nainai really worked. As she said in the story, “I wonder now if my mom or dad was diagnosed with something terminal they didn't know, would I lie to them? And if it was me, would I want to know?” Wang avoided a dead end in this story, that is whether ignorance is good or not in this situation. Instead, she raised a question to herself and to all the listeners. The story then became the one that we can take something from and think about.</p>
        <p>Actually, I don’t agree with what Wang’s family did because I think people with cancer or incurable diseases have rights to make their own decisions and arrangements in the last days. But that doesn’t prevent me from loving this story. However, it makes me think more and think for a longer time, and maybe I will recall this story when I have to face the same situation. All stories have to end, but those good ones will always find you some day later in your life.</p>
