        <h2><a href="/writing/shuafat">Shuafat – “We Are Orphans Here” Essay Critique</a></h2>
        <p>Novelist Rachel Kushner spent a weekend in the Shuafat Refugee Camp in East Jerusalem, where she felt both safe and obscene. Recounting her time there in her first journalistic piece <em>&quot;We Are Orphans Here&quot;</em>, Kushner, a privileged outsider, vividly describes the camp through stark contrasts—life and death, peace and chaos, hope and despair—captivating and resonating with the reader. <a href="/writing/shuafat">Read more...</a></p>

        <h2><a href="/writing/podcast-review-in-defense-of-ignorance">Podcast Review: In Defense of Ignorance</a></h2>
        <p>This American Life aired an episode called “In Defense of Ignorance” on April 22nd, 2016 in which stories and examples of ignorance were shared, proving that sometimes there can be a benefit, a bliss, or even an asset to not knowing. Lulu Wang, an American writer and filmmaker, told a story about her family’s white lies towards her grandmother who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and only got three months to live. The story stands out because of its empathetic topic – sickness and death – with a unique narrative style and the open ending which is thought-provoking for listeners. <a href="/writing/podcast-review-in-defense-of-ignorance">Read more...</a></p>
